# Exercise Tracker

This project is based on the FreeCodeCamp Backend Development & API Certification project. However, I decided to do it differently from the requirements for learning purposes.

Here are the differences and their reasons:
 - Use of TypeScript
    - I wanted to gain more experience using TypeScript
 - Prisma ORM over Mongoose
    - I enjoy the way Prisma keeps the database in sync
    - I really like how easy it is to enforce schemas and how it ensures type-safety
 - PostgreSQL over MongoDB
    - I personally prefer using a relational database over a noSQL database because it's more structured
    - I kind of wanna try using AWS RDS or Render's Database as a Service
 - Deployed through Render
    - I was planning to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk cause I am trying to learn more about AWS, failed for some reason. Will look back into it
    - Alternative is to use Render, which is another PaaS that I wanted to try, ever since Heroku starts limiting their free tier
